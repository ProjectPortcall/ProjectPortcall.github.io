                <p>Kristy and Jerry, a dynamic couple and the visionaries behind ProjectPortcall, met during their time at Georgia Tech. With Kristy's extensive experience in management at Accenture and Jerry's impressive background as an F/A-18 pilot, they bring a unique blend of skills and perspectives to the company. Having lived in diverse locales such as Florida, Texas, Japan, and now Virginia Beach, Virginia, their passion for travel and experiencing global cultures fuels their mission to bring world flavors to the community.
